# 🛠️ Self-Healing Data Pipeline

This Python-based project implements a self-healing data pipeline that detects, validates, and automatically repairs data issues using rule-based validation and intelligent correction mechanisms.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
python project for cv/
├── main.py                  # Entry point to run the pipeline
├── pipeline.py              # Orchestrates validation, detection, and repair
├── detector.py              # Identifies data anomalies and quality issues
├── repair_engine.py         # Contains logic to fix or impute bad data
├── validation_rules.py      # Rule set for schema and value checks
├── core.py                  # Helper functions / shared utilities
├── test_data.json           # Sample data for testing the pipeline

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Validates incoming data with custom rules  
- 🔍 Detects missing, inconsistent, or invalid data patterns  
- 🔄 Automatically repairs corrupted or missing entries  
- 🧪 Supports modular validation and repair rule sets  
- 🔄 Can be extended for real-time or batch processing  

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **`main.py`** runs the pipeline on sample data  
2. **`validation_rules.py`** defines the data quality expectations  
3. **`detector.py`** flags any violations of the rules  
4. **`repair_engine.py`** fixes the data issues  
5. Logs are printed or saved for traceability

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-healing-pipeline.git
cd self-healing-pipeline
```

### 2. Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Note: If `requirements.txt` is not present, use `pip install pandas numpy` or add required packages manually.)*

### 4. Run the pipeline
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📈 Sample Output

```bash
[INFO] Validating input data...
[WARN] Missing value detected in 'age' column
[ACTION] Imputing missing value with median: 34
[SUCCESS] Data validation and repair complete.
```

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Integrate with real-time data ingestion (Kafka, APIs)  
- Add machine learning-based anomaly detection  
- Build a logging dashboard for monitoring  
- Export repaired data to databases or cloud storage
